# VSC GAME ENGINE

this was made as a school project for Gradia's TVTPT23 class

in this school project i initially wanted to make a simple Pig Cardgame but ended up working on a game engine
for multiple multi/single player games played inside Visual Studio Code Terminal via Text Prompts


These game work by entering text prompts as responses to terminal questions

MUD - Multi-User Dungeon
Multi user dungeons are a old fashioned receive and type games where the terminal gives you a brief info and you tell it how to continue onward from that point.

PDC - Pig Dice Game
as many players as you want to add. rolling the dice to get the desired amount of points. rolling 1 resets your score and ends your turn

RPS - Rock, Paper, Scissors
classic game of rock paper scissors with randomized ai selection for the other end
